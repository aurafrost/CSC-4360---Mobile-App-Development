Please note that if you CANNOT generate the app for each iOS problem,
then please include a screenshot of the app working in the simulator on your machine together with the zipped source code,
instead.  
Following these steps will result in a max 5% overall deduction for not submitting the apps for each problem.  
In other words, if you do everything else (functionally) to solve each homework problem, 
and just cannot generate the app for each problem, then you would receive a 95/100 for Homework 3.
