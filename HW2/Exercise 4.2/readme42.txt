Run the app.
The navigation buttons now link to the approprate pages and back. 
Pressing the Contact list button will take you to the contact list page.
Pressing the map button will take you to the map page.
Pressing the options button will take you to the options page.
These pages are still unimplemented though, but the buttons should all work on each page.
The button for each page will not work for its own page though, meaning the map button will not reload the map page for example.
The buttons are even greyed out when they don't work!


Note: When I generated the apk for Exercise 4.1, 
I forgot to export the .zip file before completing Exercise 4.2, 
so the source code (.zip) for both is actually the same. 
The apks are different though.
I still renamed the zips. I hope that doesn't break anything.
