Note: the exercise doesn't state that the background color has to apply anywhere but the settings page, 
so I only made it work there.

1.Run the app.
2.Click the third button on the bottom to reach the settings page.
3.The page will be orange by default with the circular button labeled "Orange" selected.
4.Press on any of the other four labeled color buttons to change the color of the page.
5.Exit and close the app.
6.Reopen the app and go to the settings page to see that the color setting and button are the same as when you exited.
