1.Run the app.
2.The contact list is empty by default. We need to add at least the name for three contacts before seeing the colors.
3.Press the off button then fill in the name field with whatever.
4.Press save.
5.Press on the list button on the bottom.
6.Press the add contact button.
7.Repeat steps 3-6 twice more.
8.Press on the contact list button on the bottom again.
9.See that the names alternate in color!
Note: The only requirement of the exercise is that the names alternate colors in red and blue. 
	What color it begins with doesn't matter since it stated that was just an example.
